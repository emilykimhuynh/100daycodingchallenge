# 100 Day Coding Challenge
## Proof that I can code for 100 days straight (hopefully)

This past year, I read an article on Medium [to be linked when I find it] about a girl that coded for 365 days straight. As a result, she learned 7 different programming languages, received a job offer from Apple, and accepted an internship at Nylas. 

Honestly, I probably wouldn't be able to commit (literally) for an entire year. I'm challenging myself to commit to GitHub every day for 100 days. I won't necessarily be committing code, because a lot of what I'm coding is at work, and for obvious reasons, I can't share that. Instead, I'll keep a running list of the day and a general idea of what I coded that day.

I'm doing this challenge to better myself both in discipline and in programming ability. Hopefully by the end, I'll have a 100 day GitHub streak and a job offer (I'm looking at you, Pinterest).

### Ideas

Programming projects/topics that I would like to learn at some point in my life. I definitely won't get to all of them in 100 days, but hopefully by the end of this challenge I'll be in the habit of coding every day.

	- Ruby
	- Swift
	- Cracking the Coding Interview (book)
	- Fix my programming language so that it actually works (Macchiato, created in CS 403)
	- Create a compiler for my programming language
